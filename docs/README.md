# Dataverse HTML Tools

The recommended installation is [Dataverse HTML Tools Suite](DataverseHTMLToolsSuite.md). It provides the `Admin Tools` model-driven app, dedicated User and Team forms, standalone pages, and all included web resources.

Individual tool packages remain available for partial deployments where the Suite is not required.

The Suite includes eight HTML web resources built to make Dataverse and Power Platform administration easier inside model-driven apps:

1. **User Effective Security Roles** - User form helpers for viewing and managing roles and team memberships, plus a read-only record-access view for shares, Field Security Profiles, and hierarchy context.
2. **User Record Access** - a companion User form helper for reviewing explicit record shares, Field Security Profiles, and hierarchy context.
3. **Role Table Permission Copier** - an admin helper for cloning roles and copying table permission patterns across many tables.
4. **Team Role and People Manager** - a Team form helper for managing team security roles and owner-team membership, with read-only Entra group membership handling.
5. **Flow Dependency Viewer** - a solution-level helper for viewing cloud-flow dependencies, activation order, required environment variables, and missing environment-variable values.
6. **Solution Service Inspector** - an inventory helper for reviewing solutions, apps, flows, connected services, SharePoint URLs, sharing signals, and non-authoritative migration signals.
7. **Business Unit Configuration** - a filtered, sortable user list for previewing and batch-moving users between business units with optional permission cloning.
8. **Tenant Role Catalogue** - a standalone role inventory page for current-environment reads, imported Power Automate tenant catalogues, JSON/CSV export, and explicit reviewed role-create request generation.

Tenant Role Catalogue tenant-wide inventory and create execution still require separately configured Power Automate automation; importing the Suite bundles the UI only.

All tools are designed to run as **Dataverse HTML web resources** so they can use the signed-in admin's Dataverse context and `Xrm.WebApi`.

## Recommended deployment

1. **Recommended:** open the maker portal for the target cloud, then import the managed or unmanaged [Dataverse HTML Tools Suite](DataverseHTMLToolsSuite.md). It installs the `Admin Tools` model-driven app and all included tools.
2. **Partial deployment:** import an individual tool solution ZIP from `packages`, publish customizations, then add the web resource to an existing admin model-driven app or form.
3. **Manual deployment:** add a tool HTML file as a **Webpage (HTML)** web resource, publish customizations, then add it to an existing admin model-driven app or form.

Recommended placement:

| Tool | Recommended location |
|---|---|
| User Effective Security Roles | User (`systemuser`) form; pass the record ID |
| Role Table Permission Copier | Standalone admin app page/navigation item |
| Team Role and People Manager | Team (`team`) form; pass the record ID |
| Flow Dependency Viewer | Standalone admin app page/navigation item; optionally pass `solutionReference` |
| Solution Service Inspector | Standalone admin app page/navigation item; same-environment solution/app/flow inventory |
| Tenant Role Catalogue | Standalone admin app page/navigation item; current-environment role inventory plus imported Power Automate collector JSON |

## Security model

These tools do **not** bypass Dataverse security. They run as the currently signed-in user and require that user to have the privileges needed to read users, roles, teams, metadata, solutions, cloud flows, dependencies, environment variables, and to update role/team assignments, role privileges, or flow state.

For Entra-backed teams, membership is shown read-only and managed through Microsoft Entra ID. The Team manager includes a link to the Entra group when Dataverse exposes the group object ID.
