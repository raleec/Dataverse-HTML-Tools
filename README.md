# Dataverse HTML Tools

Lightweight Dataverse and Power Platform admin tools built as HTML web resources for model-driven apps.

These tools run in the signed-in user's Dataverse context through `Xrm.WebApi`. They do not require a separate service, plug-in, desktop client, or app registration for the admin UI.

## Install

Install [Dataverse HTML Tools Suite](tools/dataverse-html-tools-suite/README.md) for the complete supported experience. It includes the `Admin Tools` model-driven app, dedicated User and Team forms, all web resources, and standalone tool pages. Use the [managed or unmanaged Suite ZIP](packages/dataverse-html-tools-suite) as the primary installation option.

Install an individual solution only when the target environment needs a specific tool and not the full Suite. Individual packages require you to add their web resource to an existing model-driven app or form.

## Deployment

Use one of these deployment paths:

1. **Suite install:** import the Dataverse HTML Tools Suite managed or unmanaged ZIP from [`packages/dataverse-html-tools-suite`](packages/dataverse-html-tools-suite). This is the recommended option.
2. **Individual package:** import a tool's managed or unmanaged ZIP from [`packages`](packages), publish customizations if prompted, then add its imported web resource to an admin model-driven app.
3. **Manual install:** add the tool's HTML file as a Dataverse **Webpage (HTML)** web resource, publish customizations, then add that web resource to an admin model-driven app.

Use `themeOption=darkmode` when a model-driven app URL should force dark mode. The pages also handle that flag when it is encoded in the web resource `data` parameter. Dataverse/Power Platform HTML tools should default to light mode unless that explicit dark-mode flag is present.

The Suite includes Tenant Role Catalogue as an `Admin Tools` standalone page. Tenant-wide inventory and role-create execution still require the separately configured Power Automate collector/create workflows described in the tool folder.

## Security model

The tools do not bypass Dataverse or Power Platform security. All reads and writes run as the currently signed-in user. Restrict access with model-driven app access, web resource visibility, and Dataverse security roles.

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for implementation notes and review guidance.

## Adding future tools

Add each new tool under `tools\<tool-slug>` with its own `README.md`, source files, and optional packaging project. Update this README and [`docs\README.md`](docs/README.md) when adding a tool.
